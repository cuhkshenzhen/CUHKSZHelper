# Moodle Helper for CUHKSZ

This is a moodle helper for [CUHKSZ moodle system](https://elearning.cuhk.edu.cn/). Currently, it can tell you what things the professor has uploaded since your last visit, so you will no longer need to visit the page of every course to find the newly-uploaded things.

This is just a minimum version, a prototype of what will be done. So the function will be enhanced greatly in the future.
